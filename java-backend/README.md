# Assignment 1 - Java

Welcome to Assignment 1! This is the Java setup repository for Assignment 1. You can find the assignment PDF on Canvas.

## Installation

To get started, you will need to have Java and Gradle installed on your machine. If you don't have them installed, you can download them from the official website: [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
## Assignment

Currently, this is just starter code with a basic test case. 
Your task is to implement a REST API for a fitness center, according to the design specifications in the assignment PDF. You are free to use any framework of your choice. We recommend using [Spring](https://spring.io/) as a good starting point.

Once you have created your API, you should also write tests for it. Your tests should hit all the endpoints in your API and should ensure that they are working correctly. Make sure to test both correct and incorrect API calls.


To test - 
```
gradle test
```

## Submission

To submit your assignment, you should take a (FULL) screenshot of all your tests passing and your code passing linting.

You should then upload your screenshot to the assignment submission page on Gradescope.

Good luck and have fun!
